## 👨‍💻 About Me

I hold a Bachelor’s degree (Bac+3) in Pharmaceutical Sciences and have **5 years of experience as a QA Tester**, specializing in **medical systems and pharmacovigilance**, with strong skills in **test automation**.

Currently, I am transitioning into **cybersecurity**, driven by a strong interest in **threat detection, risk management, and security process improvement**.  
I am actively developing my technical skills through hands-on platforms such as **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**, where I focus on defensive security, monitoring, and incident analysis.

My goal is to bridge my background in regulated environments with cybersecurity best practices to contribute effectively to security operations.

## 🎯 Objective

To pursue a career in cybersecurity where I can apply my analytical mindset, automation skills, and experience in regulated environments to **security monitoring, threat detection, and risk management**.

I am seeking an opportunity to gain hands-on experience, apply my technical knowledge in real-world scenarios, and continuously improve security processes within a SOC or defensive security team.
